# COBOL for the shits and giggles

Sample code for my online course "<a href="https://tinyurl.com/bdeafea5">COBOL for the shits and giggles</a>" on YouTube.
The numbers at the beginning of each filename indicate which chapter of the course they belong to.

I use the <a href="">GnuCOBOL</a> compiler to test the examples in this course, together with the flag <tt>std=ibm</tt> to enforce the IBM COBOL dialect.
